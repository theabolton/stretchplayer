1. System Requirements
----------------------

Composite is supported on the following operating systems:

  * Linux/Unix/BSD

Composite is not yet supported on Windows or OS X.  If you would like
to help, please let me know.  <gabriel@teuton.org>

StretchPlayer is very calculation-intensive (via librubberband).  It
is known to /not/ work on PIII 800 MHz machines because they're not
fast enough.

  Pentium 4 1200 MHz
  512 MB RAM
  Consumer-Grade (cheap) audio card
  Keyboard and Mouse

2. Download
-----------

StretchPlayer's source code can be downloaded for the home page:

	http://www.teuton.org/~gabriel/stretchplayer/

The source code for the current development version can be checked out
via Git:

	$ git clone git://gitorious.org/stretchplayer/stretchplayer.git

3. Binary Packages
------------------

There are currently no binary packages available.

4. Prerequisites to Build from Source
-------------------------------------

In order to build from source, you will need the following libraries
installed on your system, and the development header files.

	REQUIRED
	* Qt 4 Library (>=4.5.0)
	* Qt 4 SDK (moc, uic, etc.)
	* GNU g++ compiler (>=4.0, 3.x might work)
	* CMake (>= 2.6, earlier might work)
	* JACK (jack1 >= 0.109.0, jack2 >= 1.9.3, earlier ones may
          work on some systems)
	* libsndfile >=1.0.17
	* librubberband

On a dual-core, 32-bit, 1800MHz processor using a parallel build,
StretchPlayer takes about 10 seconds to compile.

5. Build and Install from Source (Simple)
-----------------------------------------

After you have all the prerequisites, building and installing will
look like this:

	$ tar xjf stretchplayer-0.500.tar.bz2
	$ cd stretchplayer-0.500
        $ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake .. \
		-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
		-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
	$ make
        $ sudo make install

     +---------------------------------------------------+
     | NOTICE:  BUILDING WITH 'cmake .' IS NOT SUPPORTED |
     +---------------------------------------------------+

To change the directory where StretchPlayer is installed, it is done like
this on the last step:

	$ sudo make install DESTDIR=/mnt/chroot

THERE IS NO UNINSTALL. USE A PACKAGE MANAGER.

Composite uses a tool that detects the correct Qt settings.  Please
make sure that qmake for Qt4 is in your path... and all will be well.

___CREATING A BINARY PACKAGE___

If you are a package maintainer and wish for your packaging scripts to
be included in the StretchPlayer source tree, we would be happy to work
with you.  Please contact Gabriel Beddingfield <gabriel@teuton.org>.

6. Build and Install from Source (Detailed Configuration)
---------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, CMake doesn't have something that works exactly like
'./configure --help' that will show you all the configuration
options.  The best way to see the standard options is to run:

	$ ccmake /path/to/sources/stretchplayer-0.500

Which will give you a listing of the options from the CMakeLists.txt
file.  You have the following commands (and more) available:

	h - get help on the current field/option
	c - Reconfigure
	g - Generate makefiles
	t - Toggle advanced mode so that you can set
            -funroll-loops -fomit-frame-pointer

The following information is for your convenience, and is bound to go
out-of date as things change:

  DEBUG BUILDS -- Either `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug /path/to/srcs`
                  or     `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo /path/to/srcs`

  PREFIX -- `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local /path/to/srcs`

  DESTDIR -- With GNU Makefiles, `make install DESTDIR=/mnt/chroot`
